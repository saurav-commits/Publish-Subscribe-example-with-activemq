# Publish-Subscribe-example-with-activemq
In this java program i have used spring boot, activemq server to run a small JMS PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE program where the sender sends a message and the reciever on other end recieves who has subscribed for the service
to run this program steps are
a. visit "https://start.spring.io" and get maven project add web and activemq in dependencies
b. install activemq server and run it in the bin folder of activemq command - "activemq start"
c. copy the programs with specific packages 
d. add properties too.
e. run the standalone program.
f. and now on localhost 8161 check the queues and topic to see the reflection.
g.for publishng a message in specified localhost add - rest/publish/message.
h. and now see the console the message is reflected in the console
